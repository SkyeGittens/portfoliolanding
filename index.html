<h2>Welcome to my portfolio!</h2>

<!--Main Body-->
<div class="container">
<p>My name is Skye, and this is a portfolio as a new Developer! Ever since I was young, I have been absolutely enamored with <strong>Technology</strong>! I have been in the tech support field for about 9 years, and grew up with a love of online gaming and programming. This is just <em>the beginning</em> of a new and bright future for my endeavors.</p>

<h4 id="header">My inspiration</h4>
<p>First, Here are the driving forces behind my madness.</p>
  <div class="imageholder">

<p>Without these 3 fuzzballs, my life would be a lot more empty. I also am an “Amateur Cellist”. My devotion to art is fierce, and I incorporate it in my life and it fuels my passions to create and explore places I have never explored.</p>

<h4 id="header">My work</h4>
<p>Here is a list of the works I have (or attempted) to complete. These are always subject to change, and if anything are more of a place holder as my skills will forever be developing.<br>
