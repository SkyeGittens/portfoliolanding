  <!--Main Body-->
    <span class="intro"> Greetings!</span>
      <p>My name is Skye, and this is a portfolio as a new Developer! Ever since I was young, I have been absolutely enamored with <strong>Technology</strong>! I have been in the tech support field for about 9 years, and grew up with a love of online gaming and programming. This is just <em>the beginning</em> of a new and bright future for my endeavors.</p>

  <h3 id="header">My inspiration</h3>
  <p>Here are some of my pets! They help to keep me realizing my goals and wanting to provide a much better <em>life</em> for them always!</p>

  <p>Without these 3 fuzzballs, my life would be a lot more empty. I also am an “Amateur Cellist”. My devotion to art is fierce, and I incorporate it in my life and it fuels my passions to create and explore places I have never explored.</p>
